Subject: Introduction to React.js

Objective: The aim of this assignment is to deepen your understanding of React.js and its event handling mechanisms. You will learn how to handle events, bind event handlers, and pass methods as props in React components.

Note: Before starting this assignment, make sure you have a basic understanding of React.js and its components.

Instructions:

Part 1: Events and Event Handling

1.1 Explain what events are in the context of React.js.
1.2 List and briefly describe at least five common events in React.js.
1.3 Create a React component with a button that changes the text of a paragraph when clicked. Use the onClick event for this purpose.
1.4 Implement a React component that includes a text input field. Display an alert message showing the value entered by the user when the onInput event is triggered.

Part 2: Binding Event Handlers

2.1 Explain the concept of binding in relation to event handlers in React.js.
2.2 Describe the significance of binding event handlers, especially when dealing with the this keyword.
2.3 Create a React component containing a button. When the button is clicked, display a message that includes the current count of clicks. Ensure that the event handler is appropriately bound to the component.

Part 3: Passing Methods as Props

3.1 Define the concept of passing methods as props in React.js.
3.2 Explain why passing methods as props is useful in React.js development.
3.3 Develop two separate React components: a parent component and a child component. The parent component should contain a state variable, counter, and a method incrementCounter. The child component should have a button that, when clicked, calls the incrementCounter method in the parent component and updates the counter value.

Part 4: Integration and Demonstration

4.1 Combine the components from Part 1 and Part 3 to create a cohesive React application.
4.2 Test the application to verify that the events are handled correctly, and the methods are successfully passed as props between the parent and child components.
